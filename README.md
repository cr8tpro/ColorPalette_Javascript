# ColorPalette_Javascript
Select colors range from two areas

If you want to get specific colors between two rgb area use this color palette.
Suppose you are going to get colors between "#231234" and "#331234".
There will be many colors between them but you can't increase number one by one because it is not ruled by increasing one.
Hope this help for you.
